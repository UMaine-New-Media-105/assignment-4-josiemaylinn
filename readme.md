Assignment 4 tasked me with using coded loops to create repeating patterns witihn the canvas.

For the first challenge I made a custom function called drawStar which used a for loop to add a triangle and then repeat and rotate the shape a specific amount of times that I can specify. I used this function three times to create seperate shapes with different colors to showcase the functionality of my code.

For the second challenge, I used a for-loop as well as my custom function to create a repeating grid of identical shapes. The for-loop lets me add to the X and Y values of the shape everytime it is drawn, creating equal distance between them.

Third, I modified the second program to add variability to the grid. I added an array of colors that is randomly chosen from everytime a new pattern is drawn. I also changed the code so that the number of repetitions in the shape can vary within a range of five to ten.

Last, moving away from the previous code, I came up with three custom functions to create a circle, square and triangle and place them in the middle of the canvas. I added these functions to an array and then wrote a loop to allow all the functions to be called in order from the array.
